            In the 1960s, NASA scientist and engineers began sending robotic
            probes to explore our planetary neighbors. This greatly expanded
            our knowledge of theses worlds and gave us entirely new, close-up
            views of the inner planets that we could only before dream of.
            This began a new age of exploration, bringing into our reach those
            distant mysterious discs.

            By the 1970s our sights were set on the outer planets, just as a
            special opportunity presented itself; the outer planets were soon
            to be positioned in a way that allowed two spacecraft to efficiently
            visit the four outer planets, a Grand Tour of the outer solar
            system. One probe would be sent to Jupiter, and Saturn, with another
            to all four. Both would utilize the gravity assist maneuver to
            propel them to their next target.

            launch could have been adjusted to have it visit all four outer
            planets. Thankfully it was successful and on September 5,
            1977 Voyager 1 was launched on its accelerated course to Jupiter.

            With the 60 wide angle frames, narrow angle images were taken of
            the planets as well, including the famous Pale Blue Dot. These
            pictures are the furthest pictures ever taken of our Sun and Planet.

            The next milestone for the Voyager spacecrafts was to pass the
            termination shock, or where because of interaction with the
            interstellar medium, the speed of the solar wind slows down to
            subsonic speeds relative to the sun. After about nine more years of
            travel, both probes eventually crossed the heliopause and entered
            the interstellar medium, and exiting the Sun's protective
            magnetosphere. The probes still continue to send data from the
            cosmic ray system, low-energy charged particle instrument, plasma
            sensors, magnetometers, and radio astronomy antennas.

            Engineers hope to continue the mission for as long as the spacecraft
            continue to send data. Current plans power management strategies
            will keep the probes operational for a few more years. As they
            continue on, silent, they will pass by other stars in the galaxy,
            and possibly be discovered by intelligent life, on which they will
            find a golden record, containing a message in a bottle.
            A message from the human race saying "Hi, this is who we are."
